# Template for p5 and react

## Introduction

This is a scaffold for react&typescript&p5.js

***

* What is react?
Oh, react is similar for us. After all it is one of the most popular frontend-framework. This is the [official website](https://reactjs.org/)

* What is typescript?
TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types. The experience of developing by typescript is better than javascript in vscode, which is similar to the java developing in IntelliJ. This is the [official website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

* What is p5.js?
This is new to most of developer. It is a creative coding framework based on javascript, like openFrameworks(based on c++), processing(based on java). Usually designer could use it to do some creative idea. So the api of p5.js is user friendly. So I make this template.
